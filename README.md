# Image-Classification-with-PyTorch
This project demonstrates a simple image classification task using PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning library for Python. The goal is to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes (e.g., airplanes, cars, birds, etc.).
